\section{A criterion for unconcreteness}
The proof of \athm\refbf{honoconc} relies on
\begin{itemize}
\item the existence of Moore spaces;
\item the existence of the homology functors; and in particular
\item their interplay with suspension.
\end{itemize}
Not every model category has a notion of homology. But in various pointed model categories we can define \emph{homotopy groups} (in fact, with respect to arbitrary coefficients on an object $A$) via the suspension-loop adjunction. Adapting Freyd's proof to this somewhat ``dual'' situation constitutes the original result of the present work. The discussion so far has been tailored to let the proof of \athm\refbf{ginnunga} seem obvious; this proof will occupy the rest of the present section.
\subsection{Homotopy groups on model categories}
We start re\-cal\-ling how homotopy groups with coefficients can be constructed in a pointed model category; for the record, we simply adapt the construction that \cite[Â§II.6]{Baues1989} performs in the fairly more general setting of cofibration categories.
\begin{definition}[$\Sigma\dashv \Omega$ adjunction, homotopy groups]\label{sigmomega}
Let $\M$ be a pointed model category,  one can define the \emph{suspension-loop adjunction} via the following diagrams that are, respectively, an homotopy pushout and an homotopy pullback
\[
\begin{kodi}
\obj{
	|(M)|\ho(\M) &[2em] |(pM)| \ho(\M) &[3em] |(pM')| \ho(\M) &[2em] |(M')| \ho(\M)\\[-2em]
	X &|(1a)| 0 & \Omega Y &|(1b)| 0\\
	|(1c)| 0 & \Sigma X &|(1d)| 0 & Y \\
};
\mor X -> 1a -> {Sigma X};
\mor * -> 1c -> *;
\mor {Omega Y} -> 1b -> Y;
\mor * -> 1d -> *;
\mor M \Sigma:-> pM; \mor pM' \Omega:-> M';
\pushout{X}{Sigma X}
\pullback{Omega Y}{Y}
\end{kodi}
\]
It is easy to notice that the two functors $\Sigma, \Omega$ form an adjunction, in that arrows $A\to \Omega B$ correspond bijectively to arrows $\Sigma A \to B$.
With this definition we pose
\[
\pi^A_n(X) :=  \ho(\M)(A, \Omega^n X).
\]
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}\label{ocio-coef}
This definition is of course compatible with shifting, in the sense that, as a consequence of the adjunction $\Sigma\dashv \Omega$, we have $$\pi^A_n (\Omega (X)) = \pi^A_{n+1}(X).$$ In our discussion coefficients will be hidden just for notational simplicity. Of course this is a group when $n \geq 1$ and it is abelian when $n\geq 2$.
\end{remark}


\subsection{The main theorem}
\begin{remark}
The idea of our theorem in a nutshell is: if you can realize a ``weak classifying object'' $k(G)$, for at least the abelian groups in the black box lemma, then a construction similar to that of Freyd's proof generates a proper class of quotients for a chosen object $K$.

An exact translation of Freyd's argument is impossible in a general setting, due to the lack of a `universal' homology theory on a general model category, and yet the main result is preserved with only a few adjustments. The main \emph{idea} is, indeed, absolutely unchanged in this translation procedure. We briefly outline the reasons why we are constrained to these adjustments:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First of all we must switch to generalized \emph{quotients}, since we work with homotopy groups, and this consequently forces us to play with \emph{looping} operations, and not suspensions; this forces to consider \emph{fiber sequences} in the homotopy category of $\M$.
	\item This entails that we have to build a proper class of generalized regular quotient $K \to K_\alpha$ for some object $K$. And yet we can't expect the existence of maps $B_\alpha \to \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ that are nonzero on $x_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$ (this is because $B_\alpha$ contains a cyclic direct summand of order $p$ generated by $x_\alpha$, so there will always be a homomorphism $B_\alpha\to B_\beta$ sending $x_\alpha$ to $x_\beta$).
	\item Fortunately, the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ plays no special r\^ole in the proof; we can safely assume that each $B_\alpha$ has a group homomorphism $B_\alpha \to \QZ$ that does not vanish on $x_\alpha$ (and these always exist, since $\QZ$ is injective).
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}
\begin{definition}[Weak classifying object]\label{wcodef}
Let $\M$ be a model category, and $\cate{K}$ any category. A \emph{weak classifying object} for $\M$, relative to a functor\footnote{The symbol $\varpi$ is an alternative glyph for the Greek letter $\pi$.} $\varpi \colon \ho(\M) \to \cate{K}$ is a functor $k\colon \cate{K} \to \ho(\M)$ such that
\begin{itemize}
	\item the composition $\varpi\circ k$ is a full functor;
	\item there is a natural transformation $\epsilon\colon \varpi\circ k \Rightarrow 1$ which is an objectwise epimorphism (in this case $k$ is a \emph{right} \wco), \emph{or} a natural transformation $\eta \colon 1\Rightarrow \varpi\circ k$ which is an objectwise monomorphism (in this case $k$ is a \emph{left} \wco).
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{notat}
We speak of a \emph{weak classifying object} $k$ (without specifying a side) when we do not care about $k$ being a left or right weak classifying object.

When a model category $\M$ has a \wco relative to the functor $\pi_n \colon \ho(\M) \to \cate{Grp}$ (see \refbf{ocio-coef}) we say that it has a \emph{\wco of type $n$} and it will be denoted $k(\firstblank,n) \colon \cate{Grp}\to \ho(\M)$. No effort is made to hide that the notion of a \wco is an abstraction, tailored to our purposes, of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces $G\mapsto K(G,n)$ on $\Top$. Of course, if $n\ge 2$, $k(\firstblank,n)$ has domain $\cate{Ab}$.
\end{notat}
\begin{remark}
Having found a \wco of type $n_0$ for some $n_0\ge 2$ entails that there is a \wco also for every other $\pi_m$, with $m>n_0$; in fact it can be easily checked that the functor 
\[
k(\firstblank,n_0+k) := \Omega^k \circ k(\firstblank,n_0)
\]
is a \wco of type $n_0+k$.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
There are at least three cases where $\M$ has a \wco of type $n$: like before, we denote $\pi_n^A$ the $n^\text{th}$ homotopy group functor (see \refbf{ocio-coef}) for \emph{some} $n\ge 1$ and \emph{some} coefficient object $A$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item When $\pi_n^A\colon \ho(\M)\to \cate{Ab}$ has a section (\ie there is a functor $K_n$ such that $\pi_n^A\circ K_n \cong 1$);
	\item When $\pi_n^A$ has a faithful left adjoint;
	\item When $\pi_n^A$ has a full right adjoint.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}
We now come to the main theorem of this work:
\begin{theorem}\label{ginnunga}
Let $\M$ be a pointed model category; if there exist an index $n\ge 2$ and a \wco of type $n$ for $\M$, then $\ho(\M)$ can not be concrete.
\end{theorem}
The proof occupies the rest of the section. We establish the following notation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item we assume that there exists a \emph{right} \wco; with straightforward modifications the proof can be adapted to the case of a left \wco with $\eta\colon 1 \Rightarrow \pi_n\circ k(\firstblank,n)$;
	\item the object $K_\alpha$ is the image of the group $B_\alpha$ in Lemma \refbf{spastic} via the functor $k(\firstblank,n)$; we also pose $B=\QZ$ and $K = k(\QZ,n)$;
	\item we fix a map $t_\alpha \colon B_\alpha \to \QZ$ such that $t_\alpha(x_\alpha)\neq 0$ (this can always be found since $\QZ$ is an injective abelian group); we denote $u_\alpha = k(t_\alpha,n) \colon K_\alpha \to K$.
\end{itemize}
Now, consider the fiber sequence
\[
\dots \to \Omega K_\alpha \to \Omega K \xto{v_\alpha} F_{\alpha} \to K_{\alpha} \xto{u_\alpha} K 
\]
We will use the co-Isbell condition \refbf{coisbell} to prove that since
\[
(\Omega K \xto{v_\alpha} F_{\alpha})_{\alpha\in\cate{Ord}}
\]
is a proper class of generalized regular quotient for $\Omega K$, the category can't be concrete. In order to do this, we re-enact Lemma \refbf{key} in the following form using the loop functor $\Omega$ instead of $\Sigma$:
\begin{lemma}\label{peterkey}
For each pair of ordinals $\alpha < \beta$ the composition
\[
\Omega K_\beta  \xto{\Omega u_\beta } \Omega K \xto{v_\alpha} F_{\alpha}
\]
is not null-homotopic.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We argue by contradiction: assume that the composition above is nullhomotopic; since $\Omega K_\alpha \simeq \text{fib}(v_\alpha)$, we get a map (in $\ho(\M)$) $\Omega K_\beta \to \Omega K_\alpha$ that makes the triangle below commute.
\[\label{the-diag-2}
\begin{kodi}
\obj{\Omega K_\beta & \Omega K & F_\alpha \\
& \Omega K_\alpha & \\};
\mor {Omega K_beta} {\Omega u_\beta}:-> {Omega K} {v_\alpha}:-> {F_alpha};
\mor[swap] * \varphi:-> {Omega K_alpha} {\Omega u_\alpha}:-> {Omega K};
\end{kodi}
\]
But then the $\pi_{n-1}(\firstblank)$ of this commutative triangle embeds into the following bigger diagram:
\[
\begin{kodi}[remove characters=_\{\}, expand=full]
\foreach \i/\j in {0/,120/\alpha,-120/\beta}{
	\obj at (\i:1.4) {\pi_n k(B_{\j},n)};
	\obj at (\i:3.5) {B_{\j}};
	}
\mor {pi n kBalpha n} {\epsilon_\alpha}:-> {Balpha};
\mor {pi n kBbeta n} {\epsilon_\beta}:-> {Bbeta};
\mor {pi n kBn} {\epsilon}:-> {B};
\mor[swap] {pi n kBbeta n} {\pi_{n-1}(\varphi)}:{bend left},-> {pi n kBalpha n} {bend left},-> {pi n kBn};
\mor {pi n kBbeta n} {bend right},-> {pi n kBn};
\mor[swap] {Bbeta} \psi:{bend left, dashed},-> {Balpha} t_\alpha:{bend left},-> {B};
\mor * t_\beta:{bend right},-> {B};
\end{kodi}
\]
Every subdiagram made by solid arrows commutes, and the dotted arrow exists by the fullness assumption on $\pi_n\circ K(\firstblank,n)$. 

Since the $\epsilon$ arrows are all epimorphisms the outer triangle commutes. But this is impossible, since $\psi$ sends $x_\beta$ to $0$, whereas $t_\beta$ does not.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
All the arrows $v_\alpha \colon \Omega K \to F_\alpha$ form \emph{distinct} generalized regular quotient of $\Omega K$, so that $\quot(\cate{Ho}_{\Omega K/})$ contains a proper class.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $v_\alpha \asymp v_\beta$ for $\alpha < \beta$. Since in the following diagram
\[
\begin{kodi}
\obj{
&&|(Fa)| F_\beta\\[-2em]
|(OmegaKa)|\Omega K_\beta &|(OmegaK)| \Omega K & \\[-2em]
&&|(Fb)| F_\alpha\\};
\mor OmegaKa {\Omega u_\beta}:-> OmegaK;
\mor OmegaK v_\beta:-> Fa;
\mor[swap] * v_\alpha:-> Fb;
\end{kodi}
\]
the composition of $v_\beta \circ \Omega u_{\beta}$ is null-homotopic and we assumed that $v_\alpha$ and $v_\beta$ equalize the same arrows, also the composition $ v_\alpha \circ \Omega u_\beta$ is null-homotopic. This contradicts lemma \refbf{peterkey}.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Quasistable model categories}
\begin{definition}[Quasistability]
A pointed model category is \emph{quasistable} if  the comonad $\Sigma\Omega$ of the adjunction $\Sigma\dashv \Omega$ in \refbf{sigmomega} is full.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
This definition is a weakening of the stability property for $\M$, as in the stable case the comonad $\Sigma\Omega$ is full (in fact, it is an equivalence).
\end{remark}
In a quasistable model category our main theorem takes the following form:
\begin{theorem}
\label{qsginnunga}
If $\M$ is quasistable, and it has a generalized \wco for \emph{some} functor $\varpi\colon \ho(\M) \to \cate{Grp}$ such that $\varpi * \varepsilon$ is an objectwise epimorphism, then it is not homotopy concrete.
\begin{proof}
The unstable proof can be adapted in the following way: consider the sequence of groups $B_\bullet$ obtained in \refbf{spastic}, regarded as valued in $\cate{Ab}\subset \cate{Grp}$, and the diagram
\[
\tiny
\begin{kodi}[remove characters=_\{\}, expand=full,xscale=.75,yscale=.75]
\foreach \i/\j in {0/,120/\alpha,-120/\beta}{
\obj at (\i:1.5) {\varpi\Sigma\Omega K_{\j}};
\obj at (\i:3.5) {\varpi K_{\j}};
\obj at (\i:5.5) {B_{\j}};
}
\mor {varpi Sigma Omega Kalpha} -> {varpi Kalpha} -> Balpha;
\mor {varpi Sigma Omega Kbeta} -> {varpi Kbeta} -> Bbeta;
\mor {varpi Sigma Omega K} -> {varpi K} -> B;
\mor :[bend left] {varpi Sigma Omega Kalpha} -> {varpi Sigma Omega K};
\mor :[bend right] * -> {varpi Sigma Omega Kbeta} -> *;
\mor :[bend right] {varpi Kbeta} -> {varpi K};
\mor :[bend left] * \star:dashed,-> {varpi Kalpha} -> *;
\mor :[bend right] {Bbeta} t_\beta:-> {B};
\mor[swap]:[bend left] * \star\star:dotted,-> {Balpha} t_\alpha:-> *;
\end{kodi}
\]
obtained using the same notation of the unstable proof. The starred arrows appear thanks to the assumption of quasistability, and the same argument shows that there can't be no nullhomotopic sequence $\Omega K_\beta \to \Omega K \to F_\alpha$ for $\alpha < \beta$.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}
