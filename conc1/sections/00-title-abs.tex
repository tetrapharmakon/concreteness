\begin{abstract}
We generalize Freyd's well-known result that ``homotopy is not concrete''
offering a general method to show that under certain assumptions on a model
category $\M$, its homotopy category $\ho(\M)$ cannot be concrete. % with respect
%to the universe where $\M$ is assumed to be locally small. 
This result is part of an attempt to understand more deeply the relation between 
set theory and abstract homotopy theory.
